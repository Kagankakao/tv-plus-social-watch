## 🎯 Key Business Rules

1. **Voting Winner:** Highest vote count wins; if tie, host decides
2. **Synchronization:** Host's timestamp is reference → all clients seek to position
3. **Split Calculation:** `pay_i = total * (weight_i / Σweight)`, default weight = 1.0
4. **Rate Limit:** Same user cannot send consecutive chat/emoji < 2 seconds
5. **Voting Lock:** Video cannot play until ALL users vote (minimum 2 users required)
